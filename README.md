Creating the web portfolio was really challenging for me, because I am not too experienced in my field of arts to have any spectacular work, I also decided to take User Experience Design next semester, so not having that mockup had me at a really difficult start. I tried my best to gather as much photography and pictures as I can. Since I didn't have much to work with, it was definetely difficult creating a well-organized layout. I tried my best to create a grid of photos with my t-shirt designs, my photography pictures, and my graphic art sketch ideas. I also added colour borders that nicely outlined the pictures for a cleaner look, while making sure the colors look good together. I find that I work with Bootstrap the best out of all the other methods, but I still made sure to incorporate a lot of CSS styling. The only components I used that didn't belong to me were the fonts. I used a couple fonts from google fonts to tie everything together. I also used a good amount of bootstrap styling, including border color, background colors, and text color. I used colors that I personally like and think go well together. I seperated the content into 3 categories including a page about me, a page of my photography, and a page of any recent graphic designs I've created.
